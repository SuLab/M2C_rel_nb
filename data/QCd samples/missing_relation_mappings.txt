ID	Broader class
0	has relationship
1	The concept does not appear in the text
2	"The concept does appear in the text, but is wrong/misidentified/incomplete/out-of-context"
3	"Case/clinical study shows partial or inconsistent relationship (eg- related in x out of y cases, not in m out of y cases)"
4	"text explicitly mentions investigating relationship, but not an actual relationship"
5	"text explicitly mentions an association/relationship, but is not more specific"
6	"concepts are vaguely related by shared biochemical pathway/mechanism/markers, but otherwise unrelated"
